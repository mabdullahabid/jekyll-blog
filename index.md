Hi, I'm Abdullah, an aspiring developer. I love building things, hanging out with my wife, and playing with my kids.

I prefer using:  
\- Python and Django Web Framework to build powerful apps  
\- Docker Compose to develop, ship and deploy code seamlessly  
\- Amazon Web Services to host and scale efficiently
